## About The Project
This assignment was given during undergrad.

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to practice iterating through arrays. The app takes in an amount of data specified by the user, and then sorts the data for the largest and smallest value  entered. Afterwards, the app renders the results in command line.
